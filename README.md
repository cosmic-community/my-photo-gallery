## Email to Photo Feature

Send photos directly to your gallery by emailing them to: `jeffhovingaphotos@gmail.com`

2. The subject line becomes the photo caption
3. Photos are automatically uploaded and published to your gallery
4. Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (up to 10MB each)

### Setting up Email Integration:

1. **Configure your email service** (Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.) to forward emails to your webhook endpoint:
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/api/email-webhook
   ```

2. **Add environment variables**:
   ```bash
   COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG=your-bucket-slug
   COSMIC_READ_KEY=your-read-key
   COSMIC_WRITE_KEY=your-write-key
   ```

3. **Test the integration** by sending an email with photo attachments
